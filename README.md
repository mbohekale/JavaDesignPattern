# JavaDesignPattern
### What are design Patterns?

###### As an Object Oriented developer, we may think that our code contains all the benefits provided by the Object Oriented language.
The code we have written is flexible enough that we can make any changes to it with less or any pain. Our code is re-usable so
that we can re-use it anywhere without any trouble. We can maintain our code easily and any changes to a part of the code will
not affect any other part of the code.
The Design Patterns is the experience in designing the object oriented code.
Design Patterns are general reusable solution to commonly occurring problems. These are the best practices, used by the experienced
developers. Patterns are not complete code, but it can use as a template which can be applied to a problem.
Patterns are re-usable; they can be applied to similar kind of design problem regardless to any domain. In other words, we can think of
patterns as a formal document which contains recurring design problems and its solutions. A pattern used in one practical context
can be re-usable in other contexts also.
Christopher had said that “Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
doing it the same way twice”.
#### In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
##### Pattern name:
is used to provide a single and meaningful name to the pattern which defines a design problem and a solution
for it. Naming a design pattern helps itself to be referred to others easily. It also becomes easy to provide documentation for
and the right vocabulary word makes it easier to think about the design.
##### The problem describes when to apply the pattern:
It explains the problem and its context. It might describe specific design
problems such as how to represent algorithms as objects. It might describe a class or object structures that are symptomatic of
an inflexible design. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions that must be met before it makes sense to apply
the pattern.
##### The solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations:
The solution is not the complete code, but it works as a template which can be fulfilled with code. Instead, the pattern provides an
abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it.
##### The results and consequences of applying the pattern:
The consequences for software often concern space and time tradeoffs.They may address language and implementation issues as well. Since reuse is often a factor in object-oriented design, the
consequences of a pattern include its impact on a system’s flexibility, extensibility, or portability. Listing these consequences
explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them.
### Why use them?
##### Flexibility:
Using design patterns your code becomes flexible. It helps to provide the correct level of abstraction due to which
objects become loosely coupled to each other which makes your code easy to change.
##### Reusability:
Loosely coupled and cohesive objects and classes can make your code more reusable. This kind of code becomes
easy to be tested as compared to the highly coupled code.
##### Shared Vocabulary: 
Shared vocabulary makes it easy to share your code and thought with other team members. It creates more
understanding between the team members related to the code.
##### Capture best practices:
Design patterns capture solutions which have been successfully applied to problems. By learning these
patterns and the related problem, an inexperienced developer learns a lot about software design.
#### Categorization of patterns
Design patterns can be categorized in the following categories:
##### .Creational patterns
##### .Structural patterns
##### .Behavior patterns
